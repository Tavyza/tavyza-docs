          <p>OSP, or Old Standard Progaza (OSP: bafaprogaza) was an East Ijeðic language formerly spoken between modern day Xorǧarato and Progazasonu.

Other than that, it is not used anywhere in the modern day.</p>

          <h2>History</h2>
          <h3>Colonial times</h3>
          <p>Progazasonu was colonized by the Mešaiðo empire (-864 - -320, from 1 531 to 987 years ago) in the year -588 (1 255 years ago), around 4 years after the expedition of Eško Sanaþelaš Masoþase-Keistar and Ausi Huwïs Kanaþase-Aižo. The Progaza language slowly became more distinct from the <a href="/language/ijeda/">Archaic Ijeða</a> spoken in the seat of the empire, in Masoþase. 
          After around 300 years, it became distinct enough to be considered it's own language.</p>
          <h3>Warlord period</h3>
          <p>While the colony was divided post-independence, the language started fracturing, which would then give birth to <a href="/language/xorgara/">Xorǧara</a> and <a href="/language/aigakaþmon">Aigakaþmon, or Þažmasi</a>.
          Much of the warloard period happened during the Middle Progaza period, where Progaza became more and more like it is today.</p>
          <h3>The death of OSP</h3>
          <p>Old Standard Progaza began fragmenting more around the middle of the Warlord period, until the entire country had distinct regional dialects and no-one used OSP in regular conversation.
            The language would still be used as a lingua franca in the Progaza world for around 500 years, but it slowly died out. The final blow to OSP's usage was the Unification of Progazasonu, 
            and the war with the Reska. Because the united government was seated in the north of the Valley region, much of the official documents put out by it were in <a href="/language/progaza/capital">North Valley, or Capital Progaza</a>.
            This meant that OSP was no longer being used, and people didn't have much of a reason to learn it over just using their local dialect or Capital Progaza.
          </p>
          <h3>Modern-day Usage</h3>
          <p>
            In Progazasonu, OSP is only learned and used by language enthusiasts. However, it (or a varient of it) is used in Xorǧarato as the written language (known as Literary Xorǧara).
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2>Meta-History</h2>
          <p>Progaza started as a split of Archaic Ijeða, by Þeros, about 3 months into the project. It was worked on consistantly until around May of 2024, where the language was "frozen" in it's state for half a year.
            After the language was un-frozen, dialects were made and OSP was killed once and for all, replaced by Capital Progaza. Before the first freeze, it was brought into City SMP to replace the Archaic Ijeða that was being used in the nation of Zhuva.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2>Phonology</h2>
          OSP had 21 consonants and 6 vowels + 5 diphthongs. It had a syllable structure of (C)(C)V(S), where C is any consonant, V is any vowel or diphthong, and S is any consonant barring /j/ or all plosives.
